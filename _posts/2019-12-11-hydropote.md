Noun. The water deer (Hydropotes inermis) is a small deer superficially more similar to a musk deer than a true deer. Native to China and Korea, there are two subspecies: the Chinese water deer (Hydropotes inermis inermis) and the Korean water deer (Hydropotes inermis argyropus). Despite its lack of antlers and certain other anatomical anomalies—including a pair of prominent tusks (downward-pointing canine teeth), it is classified as a cervid. Its unique anatomical characteristics have caused it to be classified in its own genus (Hydropotes) as well as its own subfamily (Hydropotinae).

The genus name Hydropotes derives from the two ancient greek words ὕδωρ (húdōr), meaning "water", and ποτής (potḗs), meaning "the fact of drinking", and refers to the preference of water deer (Hydropotes inermis) for rivers and swamps.
