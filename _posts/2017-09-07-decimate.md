Verb. To reduce to one-tenth: to destroy or remove nine-tenths of anything.

This post has some context in reality as many estimates show that Hurricane Irma decimated the island of Barbuda. Over 90% of the buildings in the sole Barbudan town of Codrington were [reported destroyed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/09/07/the-tiny-islands-ravaged-by-hurricane-irma-are-in-trouble-and-begging-for-help/), with some reports stating as high as 95%. Hurricane Jose is now bearing down on the island and it's similarly-devastated neighbors.

Hurricane Irma is now heading towards Florida.
