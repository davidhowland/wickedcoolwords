Fictional. According to <a href="{{ page.source }}">cuteness.com</a>, a sploot is a type of stretch that some pets do. Although it's typically associated with corgis, many types of dogs and cats can sploot too. This special stretch is defined as a pet laying on their belly while stretching their legs out behind them.
