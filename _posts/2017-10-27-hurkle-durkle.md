Verb. To lie in bed for a long time, to lounge around

This word comes from the excellent [HaggardHawks](http://haggardhawksblog.blogspot.com/2015/03/hurkle-durkle.html) language and etymology blog. It cropped up in my twitter feed recently and I've set a personal goal to use it 10 times in regular conversation before the end of the year. Interestingly enough, it also lines up with another goal of mine: stop hurkle-durkling so much.
